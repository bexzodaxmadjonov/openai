# OpenAI Project

This is an OpenAI project developed using [OpenAI's API](https://beta.openai.com/). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of AI-powered capabilities into a web or software application.

## Features

- **AI-driven text generation**: The project leverages OpenAI's language models to generate human-like text based on input.
- **Customizable prompts**: Users can interact with the model by providing custom prompts.
- **Real-time responses**: Instant responses from the AI model, making it suitable for various use cases such as chatbots, content creation, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API**: Provides access to powerful language models.
- **Node.js** (or another backend technology, e.g., Python, if applicable): Handles server-side logic.
- **React.js** (if it's a frontend app): For building interactive user interfaces.
- **Express.js** (if using Node.js): For handling API requests.
